// Count Up By
// Create a program that takes two numbers
// - one to count to and another to determine what multiple to use to get there.

// Here is some sample input:
// Count by: 5
// Output: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

// Count to: 50
// Count by: 7
// Output: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49

// Don't forget to consider how to handle any input that might be submitted:

// empty values(user just presses enter)
// non - numeric values(It may be helpful to read up about the numerical value, NaN)
// negative numbers
// count by number is larger than the count to numbers
